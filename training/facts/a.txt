Please keep the wallet mnemonics and private key in a safe and reliable place.

## Misbehaving Users
Will users be punished by DeBox for bad behaviors such as false information and malicious links posted in DeBox?
DeBox is a decentralized social platform and DeBox will not take any action against those users. 
But all users in DeBox have specific DID identities. 
When user A commits bad behaviours above, other users will mark his DID identities, such as "spammers" or "malicious link publishers", etc., resulting in damage to the reputation of user A, and no user is willing to engage in social activities with user A, which may be one of the best ways to punish misbehaving users.

## Risk of Fraud

While participating in social activities in DeBox, please be sure to verify the reputation and tags of other users‚Äô DID first.

What should I do if I have already been scammed and caused property lost?
We are deeply sorry for your loss. However, DeBox is a decentralized platform, if you have been scammed by another user resulting in a loss of assets, we are sorry to say there is nothing we can do about your loss. What we can do is highlight the user who committed the scam. If you try to recover your assets, DeBox DAO members will do their best to assist. DeBox itself will always be a decentralized and transparent platform.

Specifically in DeBox, it is the user's interaction through this wallet to hold a certain asset or perform certain activities on the chain, which can show the real certificate of the user's interest, contribution, assets, and activity time. This kind of certificate information can constitute a DID identity.
